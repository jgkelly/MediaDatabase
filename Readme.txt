Music Database
--------------

Purpose: 
This is an attempt to teach myself some .net and database technologies 
and techniques I haven't used in a while, and provide a means of wrangling
my music collection to the ground.

Plan:
- Create a database for storing music information
- Create a Windows service that will scan the music folder for new files
  and populate the database with music metadata. 
- Create a web site that will let me view the contents of the music database. 

Ideas:
- Definitely want to include support for album art
- Possibly support for duplicate reporting
- "Near Match" artist support (i.e. "The B-52's" and "B-52s") 
- Report missing tag information (i.e. Album Artist, Year, etc.)
