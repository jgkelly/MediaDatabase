# Media Database


# Purpose: 
This is an attempt to teach myself some .net and database technologies 
and techniques I haven't used in a while, and provide a means of wrangling
my music collection to the ground.

## Plan:
* Create a database for storing music, video, and other media information
* Create a Windows service that will scan the music folder for new files
  and populate the database with music metadata. 
* Create a web site that will let me view the contents of the music database. 
* Support for multiple media volumes (i.e. music on one volume, video across multiple volumes, etc.)

## Ideas:
* Definitely want to include support for album, cover, video, fanart, etc. images
* Possibly support for duplicate reporting
* "Near Match" support (i.e. "The B-52's" and "B52s") 
* Report missing tag information (i.e. Album Artist, Year, etc.)
* Allow for folder updating for products like XBMC, etc.
